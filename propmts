#For Step 1
Create synthetic e-commerce data.
then Generate a Python script named `data_generate.py` that will create 5 CSV files inside a new folder called `data/`:

1. customers.csv  
2. products.csv  
3. orders.csv  
4. order_items.csv  
5. payments.csv  

following Requirements:
- Use synthetic data.
- make sure  relational consistency:
  - orders.customer_id must match customers.id  
  - order_items.order_id must match orders.id  
  - order_items.product_id must match products.id  
  - payments.order_id must match orders.id
- Include at least 50 customers, 20 products, 100 orders.
then Use pandas or Python csv library.
After generating the script, run it to actually create the CSV files.

Finally, show the preview of each file.
#For Step 2 
Then Write a Python script named create_db.py that performs:
1. Create an SQLite database file named `ecommerce.db`.
2. Read all 5 CSV files from folder  `data/`  
3. Create  corresponding tables in the database with proper data types:
4.Add appropriate PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints
5. Insert all the rows from each CSV file into the respective tables.
Keep the script simple and use pandas + sqlite3.
After inserting, print a preview of each table.
#For Step 3 
Create a file named queries.sql that contains:

1. Query 1:
   List all orders with customer and product details.
   Output:
   - customer_name
   - product_name
   - category
   - order_date
   - quantity
   - payment_amount
   - payment_method

2. Query 2:
   Top 5 customers by total amount spent.

3. Query 3:
   Category-wise revenue summary (total revenue per category).

Write  JOIN-based SQL queries using the tables:
customers, orders, order_items, products, payments.
